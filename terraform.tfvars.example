# Only the first values starting with a * are obligatory, the rest can remain with their default values, or you
# could adapt them to your needs.
#
# Note that some values, notably "location" and "public_key" have no effect after the initial cluster has been setup.
# This is in order to keep terraform from re-provisioning all nodes at once which would loose data. If you want to update,
# those, you should instead change the value here and then manually re-provision each node one-by-one. Grep for "lifecycle".

# * Your public key
public_key   = "/home/username/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub"
